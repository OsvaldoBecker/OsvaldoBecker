### Hi there, I'm Osvaldo 👋
- 📚 I'm a Computer Scientist graduated in 2022.
- 💻 I'm currently working as a Software Engineer.
- 🎮 I've already developed three games from scratch using Unity 3D.

  - A Virtual Reality game for chronic pain management (cognitive engagement and mindfulness meditation).
  - Two Motion Capture exergames for kinesiotherapy and improvement of functional capacity.
  - All three games are aimed at health, especially for the elderly.

#### Take a look at the repositories 🕹️🏋️
The [Boliche Virtual](https://github.com/OsvaldoBecker/Unity3D-BolicheVirtual) work was among the winners of the Undergraduate Research Works Contest (CTIC) of the 21st Brazilian Symposium on Computing Applied to Health (SBCAS).
